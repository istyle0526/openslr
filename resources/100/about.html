<strong>Multilingual TEDx (mTEDx)</strong> is a multilingual speech recognition and translation corpus to facilitate the training of ASR and SLT models in additional languages.

<p>
  The corpus comprises audio recordings and transcripts from <a href="https://www.ted.com/watch/tedx-talks">TEDx Talks</a> in 8 languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Greek, Arabic, German) with translations into up to 5 languages (English, Spanish, French, Portguese, Italian). <br/>
  The audio recordings are automatically aligned at the sentence level with their manual transcriptions and translations.<br/>
  Each <code>.tgz</code> file contains two directories: <code>data</code> and <code>docs</code>. <code>docs</code> contains a README detailing the files provided in <code>data</code> and their structure.
</p>

<p>
  Test sets for all <a href="https://iwslt.org/2021/multilingual">IWSLT 2021</a> language pairs are released in <code>mtedx_iwslt2021.tgz</code>. The references will be released after the evaluation period in April.
  <br/>
  The ST training data for pt-es, it-es, it-en are being held out for <a href="https://iwslt.org/2021/multilingual">IWSLT 2021</a> and will be released after the evaluation period in April.
